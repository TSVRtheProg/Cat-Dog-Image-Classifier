# Cat-Dog Image Classifier

## Project Overview

This project is an image classification task where a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is trained to classify images of cats and dogs. The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras and aims to predict whether an image contains a cat or a dog. The dataset consists of labeled images of cats and dogs, which are preprocessed and fed into the model to train it to make accurate predictions.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to create a deep learning model that can successfully differentiate between images of cats and dogs using a CNN. The project covers the following key aspects:
- Data preprocessing and augmentation
- Model creation using CNN architecture
- Training and evaluation of the model
- Testing the model with new images to make predictions

## Dataset and Model Files

The dataset and model files are too large to be uploaded directly to GitHub. You can download them from the following links:

## Steps to Perform

### 1. **Data Preparation**
   - Preprocess and augment the image data using `ImageDataGenerator`. This involves rescaling pixel values to a range of [0, 1], performing random transformations like horizontal flips and zoom, and organizing the data into training and testing sets.

### 2. **Model Architecture**
   - Build a CNN model with the following layers:
     - Convolutional layers to extract features from the images
     - Max-pooling layers to down-sample the image dimensions
     - A fully connected layer for classification
     - An output layer with a sigmoid activation function to classify the image as either a 'cat' or a 'dog'.

### 3. **Training the Model**
   - Compile the model with the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss function, and train it on the prepared training dataset for a set number of epochs. Evaluate its performance on the validation dataset.

### 4. **Prediction**
   - Once the model is trained, you can input new images into the model to make predictions. The model will output whether the image is classified as a 'cat' or a 'dog'.

### 5. **Evaluate and Fine-tune**
   - Evaluate the performance of the model using test data. Based on the results, you can adjust hyperparameters, improve data augmentation, or add more layers to improve accuracy.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how to build and deploy a simple yet effective CNN model to classify images of cats and dogs. It showcases the power of deep learning techniques in solving real-world image recognition problems. The model achieved reasonable accuracy after training and is capable of predicting new images with good results.

## Impact

The impact of this project is twofold:
1. **Learning Experience**: It provides hands-on experience with the fundamentals of deep learning, particularly CNNs, and their application in computer vision tasks.
2. **Practical Application**: This type of classifier can be extended for a variety of purposes, such as identifying other animals or objects, and can be used in fields like automated image moderation, animal monitoring, or even pet recognition systems.
